[{"location":"benchmarks/#Peak-finding-benchmarks","page":"Benchmarks","title":"Peak finding benchmarks","text":"Peaks.jl functions can be very fast, but some features (wider window widths, support for missing, etc) come at a performance penalty. Below, 3 example peak finding functions[1] and Images.findlocalmaxima are benchmarked against argmaxima and simplemaxima from Peaks.jl. (Only maxima type functions are benchmarked below, but similar results can be found for equivalent minima finding functions.)\n\n[1]: Currently/previously used by other Julia packages or public code. Those packages/codes are intentionally not named because they are not primarily peak finding packages, and the functions aren't part of their public API.\n\nOne important difference between the Peaks.jl functions (argmaxima, simplemaxima, etc) and Images.findlocalmaxima or the example functions is that only Peaks.jl functions recognize plateaus. Depending on the type and origins of your data recognizing plateaus may or may not be an important/relevant feature. (Quantized data, such as data sampled from physical measurements using ADC's, has a higher likelihood of plateaus.) As a result, Peaks.jl functions are doing more work, but are still competitive with other obvious implementations.\n\ntimes_plot # hide\n\nThe data generation for the above benchmark was a sine function with a peak every 5 elements; similar results are observed for more sparsely spaced peaks. However, that benchmark may not accurately reflect real-world performance when peaks are spaced more variably[2].\n\n[2]: This benchmark will be distorted by how well the CPU branch-predictor can learn each function; more predictable branches will make the function run faster than could be expected with more realistic data.\n\nWhen benchmarking against randomly sampled data, we see roughly the same performance characteristics, now presented relative to the speed of simplemaxima (higher is slower):\n\nratio_plot # hide\n\nThe large difference in speed between simplemaxima and other functions is due to the use of SIMD code for suitable input arrays and element types; see the docstring for its limitations compared to argmaxima.\n\nBenchmarked functions:\n\ndetails: `naivemaxima`\nfunction naivemaxima(x)\n   pks = Int[]\n   i = firstindex(x) + 1\n   for i in firstindex(x)+1:lastindex(x)-1\n       if x[i+1] < x[i] > x[i-1]\n           push!(pks, i)\n       end\n   end\n   return pks\nend\n\ndetails: `diffmaxima`\nfunction diffmaxima(x)\n    dx = diff(x)\n    return findall((diff(dx) .< 0) .& (dx[begin:end-1] .> 0) .& (dx[begin+1:end] .< 0)) .+ firstindex(x)\nend\n\ndetails: `viewsmaxima`\nfunction viewsmaxima(x)\n    x1 = @view x[begin:end - 2]\n    x2 = @view x[begin+1:end - 1]\n    x3 = @view x[begin+2:end]\n    return axes(x,1)[2:end-1][x1 .< x2 .> x3]\nend","category":"section"},{"location":"how-to/","page":"How-to","title":"How-to","text":"Signals often contain peaks that you aren't interested in.

This would be a good filtering option, using peakproms(pks; max=1).\nPeak width?\nThe peaks we want have fairly similar widths (~15-25 elements wide), and the other peaks have larger widths (>40 elements wide). This would be a good filter, using peakwidths(pks; max=30).\n\nIn this case, filtering by peak prominence would be the better choice, because calculating peak widths depends on prominences, so filtering by peak prominence would do the job while avoiding unnecessary work.\n\nIn many cases, the desired peaks aren't very different from many other peaks in any one peak characteristic. In these situations, it may be necessary to filter multiple times based on different peak characteristics or different min/max thresholds. There is also a filterpeaks! function which allows you to give a filter predicate and filter by multiple characteristics at once.","category":"section"},{"location":"reference/#Finding-peaks","page":"API","title":"Finding peaks","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"reference/#Peak-characteristics-and-filtering","page":"API","title":"Peak characteristics & filtering","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"reference/#Convenience-functions","page":"API","title":"Convenience functions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"reference/#Plotting","page":"API","title":"Plotting","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"reference/#Peaks.findpeaks","page":"API","title":"Peaks.findpeaks","text":"findpeaks(y[, w=1; strict=true, heights, proms, widths, relheight]) -> NamedTuple\n\nFind the maximal peaks and peak characteristics in y, and filter by the requirements given for each peak characteristic (height, prominence, etc.).\n\nPeak characteristic keywords (e.g. proms, etc) must be a NamedTuple with min and/or max fields.\n\nSee the peakwidths docstring for an explanation of the relheight keyword.\n\nSee also: findmaxima, peakheights, peakproms, peakwidths\n\nExamples\n\njulia> pks = findpeaks(Float64[0,5,2,2,3,3,1,4,0])\n(indices = [2, 5, 8], heights = [5.0, 3.0, 4.0], data = [0.0, 5.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 1.0, 4.0, 0.0], proms = [5.0, 1.0, 3.0], widths = [1.333, 1.75, 0.875], edges = [(1.5, 2.833), (4.5, 6.25), (7.5, 8.375)])\n\njulia> pks = findpeaks(Float64[0,5,2,2,3,3,1,4,0]; proms=(;max=3), widths=(;min=1.5))\n(indices = [5], heights = [3.0], data = [0.0, 5.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 1.0, 4.0, 0.0], proms = [1.0], widths = [1.75], edges = [(4.5, 6.25)])\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"reference/#Peaks.findmaxima","page":"API","title":"Peaks.findmaxima","text":"findmaxima(y[, w=1; strict=true]) -> (;indices, heights, data)\n\nFind the indices and values of local maxima in y, where each maxima i is either the maximum of y[i-w:i+w] or the first index of a plateau.\n\nReturns a NamedTuple contains the fields indices, heights, data, which are equivalent to heights = data[indices].

Peaks.jl exports functions for finding each characteristic: peakheights, peakproms, peakwidths:\n\nindices, proms = peakproms(indices, y)\n\nindices, widths, edges... = peakwidths(indices, y, proms)\n\nMutating bang ('!') functions are available (i.e. peakproms!, etc.) when allocations are a concern.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Peaks-NamedTuple-and-pipable-API","page":"Home","title":"Peaks NamedTuple & pipable API","text":"There are Peaks.jl functions that bundle the peaks, peak characteristics, and signal into a convenient NamedTuple:\n\npks = findmaxima(y);\npks = peakproms(pks);\npks = peakwidths(pks)\n\nMutating functions are also available for the NamedTuple functions; the vectors within the NamedTuple are mutated and re-used in the returned tuple. The NamedTuple functions can also be chained/piped:\n\npks = findmaxima(y) |> peakproms!(;strict=false) |> peakwidths!(; max=100)\n\nwarning: Performance tip\nBe aware that the NamedTuple functions allocate more memory than the functions with direct/explicit arguments.
